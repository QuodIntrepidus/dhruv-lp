## ðŸ‘€ Hi there! ðŸ‘€

**My name is Dhruv Bhatia**

I'm a super passionate coder and I love all kinds of development. Web dev? Game dev? Machine Learning!? Yep all of them. I'm always interested to learn new skills and use them to make projects which can help other people in some way.

So... Here's the repository for my website. I built using gatsby's starter theme. Yeah the purple and white one. I would love to have more awesome features included in my website and that's why I've made this into a public repo. Yes, it means you're free to contribute to it!

I have built using GatsbyJS and ReactJS. I have also designed this website all by myself. If there are any cool suggestions you have, please feel free to email me on **thedhruv26@gmail.com** and I'll get back in touch with you! Thanks

Happy Coding!
